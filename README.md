HTTP/2 low level library based on Scapy which can be used for Single Packet Attack (Race Condition on H2)

# Dive into Single Packet Attack Article
I wrote an article and published it at InfoSec Write-ups:
- [Dive into Single Packet Attack](https://infosecwriteups.com/dive-into-single-packet-attack-3d3849ffe1d2)

# TODO
- [Single Packet Attack - POST](https://github.com/nxenon/h2spacex/wiki/Quick-Start-Examples)
  - [x] implement
- [Single Packet Attack - GET](https://github.com/nxenon/h2spacex/wiki/GET-SPA-Methods)
  - [x] Content-Length: 1 Method
  - [x] POST Request with x-override-method: GET header
- Response Parsing
  - [x] implement
  - [x] implement threaded response parser
  - [x] add response times in nano seconds for timing attacks
  - [x] Body Decompression
    - [x] gzip
    - [x] br
    - [x] deflate
- [Proxy](https://github.com/nxenon/h2spacex/wiki/Quick-Start-Examples#proxy-example)
  - [x] Socks5 Proxy

# More Research
Some following statements are just ideas and not tested or implemented.

- More Request in a Single Packet
  - Increase MSS (Idea by James Kettle)
  - Out of Order TCP Packets (Idea by James Kettle)
  - IP Fragmentation
- Proxy the Single Packet Request through SOCKS
- Single Packet Attack on GET Requests
  - [Content-Length: 1 Method](https://github.com/nxenon/h2spacex/wiki/GET-SPA-Methods) (Idea by James Kettle)
  - [x-override-method: GET](https://github.com/nxenon/h2spacex/wiki/GET-SPA-Methods) Method (Idea by James Kettle)
  - Index HPACK Headers to Make GET Requests Smaller
  - HEADERS Frame without END_HEADER Flag
  - HEADERS Frame Without Some Pseudo Headers

# Installation
H2SpaceX works with Python 3 (preferred: >=3.10)

    pip install h2spacex


## Error in Installation
if you get errors of scapy:


    pip install --upgrade scapy


# Quick Start
You can import the HTTP/2 TLS Connection and set up the connection. After setting up the connection, you can do other things:

```python
from h2spacex import H2OnTlsConnection

h2_conn = H2OnTlsConnection(
    hostname='http2.github.io',
    port_number=443
)

h2_conn.setup_connection()
...
```
see more examples in [Wiki Page](https://github.com/nxenon/h2spacex/wiki/Quick-Start-Examples)

# Enhanced Single Packet Attack Method (Black Hat 2024) for Timing Attacks
James Kettle introduced an improved version of Single Packet Attack in Black Hat 2024 for timing attacks:

![Impvoved Version Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf7bf88c-937a-4a95-899b-990bc6fc6a23)

You can implement this method easily using `send_ping_frame()` method.

See this Wiki and `Parse Response (Threaded) + Response Times for Timing Attacks` part:
- [New Method README (WIKI)](https://github.com/nxenon/h2spacex/wiki/SPA-New-Method)

[Improved Version of SPA Sample Exploit](./examples/improved-spa-method.py)
## Reference of Improved Method:
- [Listen to the whispers: web timing attacks that actually work](https://portswigger.net/research/listen-to-the-whispers-web-timing-attacks-that-actually-work)

I also got some ideas from a previous developed library [h2tinker](https://github.com/kspar/h2tinker).

Finally, thanks again to James Kettle for directly helping and pointing some other techniques.
